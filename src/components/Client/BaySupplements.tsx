          As a consultant for Bay Supplements, I was brought on to assist in
          making critical changes to their website and resolving various bugs.
          My technical expertise allowed me to implement effective solutions
          that enhanced website functionality and user experience. By closely
          collaborating with the team, I was able to identify and address key
          issues, ensuring a smoother online presence that supported their
          business goals and improved customer satisfaction. My contributions
          played a vital role in optimizing their digital platform and fostering
          greater trust among their audience.
