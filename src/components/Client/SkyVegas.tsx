          During my tenure at Sky Betting and Gaming, I served as a fullstack
          consultant for the Vegas Campaigns squad, where I played a pivotal
          role in delivering promotions designed to enhance customer acquisition
          and retention. This involved collaborating closely with teams across
          Product, BA, Design, Delivery, and Test to architect and implement
          solutions for new campaign requirements. By leading and supporting the
          in-house development team, I ensured the successful delivery of these
          campaigns, enabling the client to surpass their two biggest
          competitors and secure the number one position in key promotional
          brand metrics. Additionally, I mentored staff at all levels, providing
          guidance on the tech stack, best practices, pair programming, and
          ongoing code reviews. My commitment to education and support helped
          streamline their workflows and fostered a culture of continuous
          improvement.
