          As part of the MyWorkplace squad, I was hand-selected to take
          ownership of the entire architecture and implementation of a modern
          mobile application designed to replace a legacy in-house system. This
          was a significant undertaking, as previous attempts by multiple teams
          had met with limited success. Collaborating closely with Product, BA,
          Design, Delivery, and Test teams, I successfully delivered a
          high-standard minimum viable product on time, providing a solid
          foundation for future development. The successful delivery was highly
          praised by the internal team, surpassing expectations based on past
          attempts. Additionally, the solution received notable recognition from
          existing customers involved in testing, who appreciated the simplicity
          and elegance of the new application.
