          At SCC France, as a fullstack consultant for the Helios squad, I
          conducted a comprehensive audit of their frontend and backend
          applications to identify potential security and performance
          enhancements. Through meticulous profiling, I discovered significant
          bottlenecks that were causing major performance issues, resulting in
          degraded user experience and potential risks to platform
          infrastructure at scale. My audit findings enabled the Helios team to
          make substantial improvements to their product, significantly
          enhancing its overall performance and reliability.
